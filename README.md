# Nexus Clash Public Issue Tracker

Welcome to the Nexus Clash public repository. This repository houses a public
issue tracker for the game Nexus Clash which is available at https://www.nexusclash.com
Please feel free to make bug reports here directly or in the [bug reporting subforum](https://www.nexusclash.com/viewforum.php?f=10).
Eventually forums reports may be integrated into this issue tracker, it is a work
in progress at this point in time.

If you are interested in creating a bug report or feature request here, there
will be some basic templates that you can follow to help give us the information
we will need to correct the issues. Please note that potentially dangerous or
game breaking bugs or vulnerabilities should be reported in private to a member
of the team. Also note that the development team is a team of volunteers that
work on this project in their free time as their lives allow, please don't expect
that all bug reports or feature requests will be corrected or implemented right
away. With that said, we do try to correct game breaking issues and exploits as
soon as we are able to.

## Joining The Team

If you are here poking around for the game code for development purposes, thank
you for taking an interest! There is no active or maintained code in this repo.
If by chance you are interested in joining the Nexus Clash development team,
please type out a little something about why you'd like to become a Nexus Clash
developer, what areas you think you'd like to work on, and just a little
introduction to yourself and your Nexus Clash history. Then please drop an admin
a forums PM on https://www.nexusclash.com or hop into our [discord server](https://discord.gg/gf87Umw) and
send a DM to any member of the team.

## Historical Archive

Also contained in this repository are the branches that were in use for the Ruby
version of the game, it is no longer in use, unmaintained, and may not even be
able to run. It could also very possibly have security issues so clone it at your
own risk!

We are however keeping it around for historical reference and because there were
contributions made from public users to it. I'd like to keep that around for
visibility sake in case someone is proud of their contribution and maybe links to
it from time to time. The last known master branch is in fact still the master
branch, it is not however the primary branch of the repository any longer.
